[edx.org](http://edx.org) can now be run on the raspberry pi! Using [Ansible](http://www.ansibleworks.com) and the
[same configuration scripts](http://github.com/edx/configuration) we use in production it's pretty straightforward to setup.  More details on the edX [engineering blog post](http://engineering.edx.org/2013/12/edx-on-the-raspberry-pi-a-portable-classroom/).
