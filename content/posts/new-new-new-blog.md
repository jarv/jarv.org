Yeah it's another blog update, just really some style updates and looking back at something I did a long time ago and say _what the heck was I thinking?_. I don't know, I think things that I don't have time to spend up usually end up being a craptastic design by copy-and-paste. Anyway, still using Pelican but upgraded to Python3 and fixed the CI configuration a bit. Got rid of the bourbon/{sass,neat} mixins because that was so 2013. Still using sass though.

* [pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican) with a [custom theme](https://github.com/jarv/water-iris)
* <s>[bourbon/sass](http://bourbon.io/) - CSS compilation and general typography</s>
* <s>[bourbon/neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/) - For layout and responsive design</s>

Oh and remove as much as possible like javascript easter-eggs and social links, because who needs that stuff :)
