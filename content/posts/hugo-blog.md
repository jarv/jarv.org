Hello world from the new blog using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as the static site generator. After cutting away the cruft from the old one, which used Pelican as a static site generator, I decided to make a switch on a lazy Sunday. I definitely think the design is much nicer and site generation is much faster! There is a great selection of themes, this one uses the [kiera](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-kiera/) which is exactly what I wanted for a layout that doesn't have too many bells and whistles.
