Below is a recent weekend programming project that I did to play with
canvas. Who doesn't like a geography game?

It uses a simple svg image for the map with a canvas overlay to detect
state clicks. On the back-end it uses a very short python script with
web.py. Most people who tried it out found the rotation to be annoying
and difficult; for me it makes it more interesting :)
