One experience of mine, though it has roughly mapped to previous side projects:

* Wow this thing that has no business model is a cool idea, I wonder if anyone has done it before?
* This is fun, let's spend an evening hacking on it
* Wow this is taking way more time than I thought it would ...
* Can I do this without spending any money? Let's use AWS free tier to get this going
* OK let's ship this thing, wow it's getting a lot of attention! Front-page on hackernews, subreddit, etc.
* I'm totally ready for this, I have a scaling plan
* Oops my scaling plan is completely useless because the bottlnecks are not where I expected they would be
* Wow traffic really drops off when it isn't on hackernews ðŸ¤”
* Oh wait someone tweeted it, there goes traffic again..
* I should probably add CI to make this a bit easier to maintain
* OK things are stable again
* Wait my free tier is about to expire, let's figure out how to host this for free by using multi-cloud
* Whoa this is taking longer than I thought
* .. years pass
* OK something is broken and getting some email complaints, I really have lost interest in this thing
* Have a free weekend, let's look at the code from years ago
* Good god, it's terrible
* Well, a bunch of things are now deprecated, let's at least fix that
* OK so if I am going through this trouble I should probably re-write some of it, especially the last parts that were just thrown together...
* Whoa this is taking longer than I thought...

Introducing a newer version of [cmdchallenge](https://cmdchallenge.com) .. A lone survivor in a sea of broken things I have had an itch to build.
