Here are some notes on how my Neovim configuration management evolved in the last year.
For longtime Vim â†’ Neovim users like me who prefer a simple and sane way to manage their configuration, I highly recommend [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) as a starting point.
It provides a minimal yet functional configuration that is easy to understand, making it ideal for those who don't want to commit to a pre-built template without knowing what it does.

## My Configuration and Workflow

1. I maintain my [own fork](https://github.com/jarv/kickstart-modular.nvim) of [kickstart-modular.nvim](https://github.com/dam9000/kickstart-modular.nvim).
   This is essentially `kickstart.nvim`, but structured into directories rather than a single `init.lua`, making it easier to manage.
2. I apply my customizations in a [single commit](https://github.com/dam9000/kickstart-modular.nvim/compare/master...jarv:kickstart-modular.nvim:master).
3. I periodically pull in upstream changes, allowing me to stay up-to-date with core plugins while maintaining my modifications.

## Customizations

I try to keep my customizations on top of `kickstart.nvim` minimal and avoid having too many plugins in general.
Even though I customize it a bit, the base plugins might be all you need as it already includes the essentials like plugin management, LSP, and general quality-of-life improvements for writing code.

Here are seven plugins that I add on top of ones included in `kickstart.nvim`:

| Plugin | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [bufferline.nvim](https://github.com/akinsho/bufferline.nvim) | Displays open buffers as tabs at the top of the session. I find this helpful for keeping track of my open buffers but there are a lot of different methods to do that. |
| [clipboard-image.nvim](https://github.com/ekickx/clipboard-image.nvim) | Useful for quickly inserting images into Markdown blog posts via copy/paste. |
| [cmp-spell](https://github.com/f3fora/cmp-spell) | Adds spell-checking suggestions to `nvim-cmp` auto-completion. |
| [karen-yank](https://github.com/tenxsoydev/karen-yank.nvim) | Prevents deletions (`D`, `dd`) from copying content into the paste register, making yanking more explicit. |
| [key-analyzer.nvim](https://github.com/meznaric/key-analyzer.nvim) | Provides a quick overview of key mappings. |
| [rose-pine.nvim](https://github.com/rose-pine/neovim) | My current colorscheme. |
| [vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) | Git integration for Neovim. |

In addition to these plugins, I have several customizations to the base config that enhance my workflow:

1. **Backups:** I enable backups using `set backup`, which has saved me a few times.
1. **Buffer Navigation:** I map `<Tab>` and `<Shift-Tab>` to switch between buffers, which pairs well with `bufferline.nvim`.
1. **Auto-complete:** I add `hrsh7th/cmp-buffer` to `cmp.lua` to enable auto-completion of words from open buffers.
1. **Mini.nvim Enhancements:** While `kickstart.nvim` includes some [`mini.nvim`](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim) plugins, I also add `mini.indentscope`, `mini.icons`, and `mini.files`.
1. **Telescope Optimization:** I modify `telescope.lua` so that when inside a Git repository, searches start from the repository root.
1. **Relative Line Numbers:** I set `vim.opt.relativenumber = true` for relative line numbering.
1. **Mouse Behavior:** I disable visual selection with the mouse, as I find it more disruptive than helpful.

Not many changes to be honest, and I've been really happy with this setup so far.
