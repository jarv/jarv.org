A quick update about some new features recently added to [SurveyMoji](https://surveymoji.com).
These are a couple of changes that should make the site easier to use, especially for anyone running multiple surveys or wanting to track what they've participated in.

1. **User accounts and login**

With the new account system you can sign up with an email and password (or log in if you already have an account).
Once logged in, any survey you create will be linked to your account automatically.

This also lays the groundwork for better access control in the future (like making surveys private, sharing them with specific users, etc.).

2. **Central survey dashboard**

Another piece that's now live is a consolidated view of your surveys. Once logged in, you'll land on a new dashboard page that lists:

- All surveys you've created
- Surveys you're participating in (for example if someone invited you to respond)
