Here is a weekend hack that uses the  [midi to AVR
conversion script and library][]. With xmas fast approaching I thought
it would be fun to convert a pacman candy tin to an xmas ornament and
have it play music. Below is the result, pressing a button on the tin
will cycle through three Ms. Pacman songs converted from midi files
found online.
