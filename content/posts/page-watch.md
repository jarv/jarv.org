This is probably my last side project before I relocate and start my new job, presenting [page-watch](https://page-watch.com).
I created it to scratch a personal itch that I had which was I was finding it difficult to track changes on websites
that were relatively static with infrequent updates. There are other page monitoring web tools out there, what makes this
one different is that it is a) dead simple b) has an rss option.

If you find it useful I would love to hear what you think, I will hopefully write a follow-up post with more technical
details when my life is a little less hectic.
