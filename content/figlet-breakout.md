I was looking for a cool ending for [cmdchallenge](https://cmdchallenge.com) and decided
to dust off a 2 year old javascript project which created a breakout game from figlet
fonts. Not quite a full re-write but fixed a lot of bugs and did away completely with
coffee-script. More info on the [github page](https://github.com/jarv/figlet-breakout).
