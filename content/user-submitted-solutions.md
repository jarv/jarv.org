Adding to the interesting [191 ways to echo hello world](/191-hello-worlds.html) I've now added the ability
to see [user-submitted solutions](https://cmdchallenge.com/s/) to [cmdchallenge](https://cmdchallenge.com).

There are some gems if you dig through them including maybe the longest regex I've ever seen for
pulling an IP address out of a file:

```
:::bash
(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)
```
Also scrolling down the page of [solutions to the corrupted text problem](https://cmdchallenge.com/s/#/corrupted_text)
is glorious.

<s>The solutions are not updated regularly right now but would be easy enough to do in the future if people want to see
more, let me know on [twitter](https://twitter.com/thecmdchallenge) and also</s> **Update**: Solutions are now generated every
five minutes. Feel free to submit suggestions for
new challenges on [github](https://github.com/jarv/cmdchallenge).
